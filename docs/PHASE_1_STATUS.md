# G.FURY Creator Studio v1 — Phase 1 Status

Authoritative reconciliation snapshot for `lalambert1982-eng/Open-Generative-AI`. Historical Production evidence below was last reconciled on 2026-08-26. The integrated completion candidate was audited locally on 2026-08-30 from `feature/integrated-creator-shell` at starting HEAD `b93226c282974bc4704b39550bb8039038f4b76a`.

**Re-verified 2026-08-31** at HEAD `640590c0f7383ec9cf6e1c9a35699bfc9d972a29` (three commits ahead of the 2026-08-30 audit: `37157f4`, `520d97b`, `640590c`), with three additional narrowly-scoped client-side fixes applied on top (Selena missing-asset handling, a stale-asset session cache guard, and a Publish double-submit guard). `npm run test:security` still passed 112/112, `node --test tests/*.test.js` still passed 38/38, `npm run test:creator-shell` still passed 21/21, and the full workspace/Next production build still passed. No credential, environment, Production, or paid-provider state was available or exercised in this pass; the determination below is unchanged.

**Merged 2026-09-01**: PR #12 ("Integrate Creator Studio operating system shell") was squash-merged into `main` as `82392ae3a379b7f96d3e0f8f1a17c8aae64810b8`, following an additional accessibility pass, a second security review, an added Selena/asset/publish regression-test suite (commit `5eca857`), and a rebase onto a concurrent owner commit (`f78a686`, "Fix Preview Creator Asset uploads"). Before merge: `npm run test:security` passed 114/114, `node --test tests/*.test.js` passed 41/41, `npm run test:creator-shell` passed 24/24, CI and the CodeQL analyze workflow passed, and the Vercel Preview build succeeded. The PR-level CodeQL check reported 4 "new" high-severity alerts; each was individually confirmed via the repository's code-scanning alerts API to be a pre-existing open finding already present on `main` before this PR (clear-text API-key storage in `useAgentAuth.js`/`StandaloneShell.js`, and SHA-256 used as an API-key digest in `handleUploadProxy.js`/`uploadTicket.js`), not a new regression. The merge triggered Vercel's standard auto-deploy of `main` to Production; a read-only post-merge smoke check confirmed `https://open-generative-ai-lemon.vercel.app/` redirects to `/studio`, which returns `200 OK`. No owner-authenticated session, real provider call, or paid generation was exercised as part of this merge. The merged branch `feature/integrated-creator-shell` was deleted after merge.

This document distinguishes four independent states:

- **Built**: the source implementation, authenticated server route, and Creator Studio connection exist.
- **Configured**: the required variables exist in the named Vercel environment.
- **Test passed**: a real request reached the external provider and completed successfully.
- **Production ready**: built, configured, real-tested, secure, documented, merged, and deployed.

Configuration is not implementation. A provider with a missing API key remains **Built — configuration required**.

## Integrated completion candidate — Merged and deployed to Production (2026-09-01)

PR #12 completes the smallest secure integration slice without rebuilding the providers or creative tools:

- Selena returns an allowlisted structured plan with server-derived approval and side-effect metadata.
- Owner-authenticated Projects and Assets persist through private Vercel Blob manifests when `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` is configured.
- Generated media, uploads, voice, Graphic Studio, Storyboard, contextual tools, and Publish share Project Asset handoffs.
- Embedded CreativeCanvas uses the authenticated Creator server adapter and no longer writes the MuAPI credential to browser storage.
- Storyboards persist to a selected Project and produce a versioned `creator.timeline.v1` manifest.
- Timeline transitions remain metadata; no compositor/render worker or finished Music Video export is claimed.

| Candidate area | Built | Configured | Tested | Production Ready |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Integrated Creator shell | Yes — merged (`82392ae3`) | Existing Preview/Production variables only; no new variables added by this PR | 24 shell tests and production build; unauthenticated smoke check of live Production | No — real owner-authenticated session not yet exercised in Production |
| Selena structured orchestration | Yes | Brain credentials not re-verified | Allowlist/approval tests; no real Brain request | No |
| Durable Projects and Assets | Yes | Requires target `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`; not re-verified through owner session | Ownership/persistence tests only | No |
| Graphic Studio secure canvas bridge | Yes | Inherits server MuAPI configuration | Proxy/security tests only | No |
| Storyboard and timeline manifest | Yes | Inherits Project/Blob and MuAPI status | Scene/request/manifest tests only | No |
| Transition rendering / final compositor | No — manifest boundary only | Not applicable | Not tested | No |

Final pre-merge verification: `npm run test:security` passed 114/114, `node --test tests/*.test.js` passed 41/41, `npm run test:creator-shell` passed 24/24, and the complete workspace/Next production build passed. The merge was pushed to `main` and Vercel auto-deployed it to Production; a read-only smoke check confirmed the live site serves `200 OK` at `/studio`. Owner-authenticated Production testing (GitHub login, Selena live requests, real Project/Asset persistence) was not performed in this pass because no owner session/credentials were available to the agent.

See [`CREATOR_STUDIO_OS.md`](./CREATOR_STUDIO_OS.md) and [`STORYBOARD_WORKSPACE.md`](./STORYBOARD_WORKSPACE.md) for current architecture and exact boundaries. Preview promotion still requires explicit approval.

## Brain Router release — Production deployed

PR #6 merged the provider-neutral Selena reasoning boundary and Greg Digital Twin hardening into `main` without recreating the existing agents. Vercel reports Production commit `3d6ea7882e8033b374dd9b9d65a51a2dcc30f1ff` as Ready. The release passed mocked/local and CI verification, but no real external-provider generation was run as part of deployment.

| Brain provider | Code Built | Preview Configured | Production Configured | Test Passed | Production Ready |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gemini | Built (Production) | Not re-verified | Not re-verified | Mock test passed | No |
| Groq | Built (Production) | Not re-verified | Not re-verified | Mock test passed | No |
| OpenRouter | Built (Production) | Not re-verified | Not re-verified | Mock test passed | No |
| Anthropic | Built (existing + router compatibility) | Not re-verified | Not re-verified | Mock test passed | No |

Initial routing is Gemini → Groq → OpenRouter with at most three attempts. Anthropic remains selectable but is not included in the initial free/developer fallback order. “Free/developer” describes the intended account tier, not a guarantee of zero cost; provider limits and billing still apply.

Provider availability still depends on the exact Preview and Production variables documented in `CREATOR_STUDIO.md`. The deployment did not copy credentials between environments or reveal saved Secret values. No real provider request was made during this release.

## MuAPI media-backbone cutover — Production deployed

The private Creator Studio image and cinematic-video tools now use one server-owned MuAPI adapter. Direct OpenAI image and Runway video implementations remain in source and in the tool registry as deferred compatibility boundaries, but they are absent from the active private dispatch and UI.

The adapter pins server-selected image, text-to-video, and image-to-video models; calls only `https://api.muapi.ai`; authenticates through the existing GitHub owner session; enforces same-origin mutations, content safety, rate limits, strict inputs, timeouts, bounded output handling, and sanitized errors; and never returns the API key. Sandbox is the default. Production mode fails closed unless the separate paid-generation flag is explicitly enabled.

A live `$0` MuAPI Sandbox mock request completed through the existing general Image Studio on 2026-08-26. PR #8 then passed CI, CodeQL, Vercel Preview, 91 security tests, 17 repository tests, Studio compilation, and the optimized Next.js production build. It merged as `3f18f446cb24d88c3b0b1b59ec53d944896d24c8`, Vercel reported the matching Production deployment Ready, and the signed-in private Creator Studio completed Sandbox image task `8c3dc22a-f59a-4c74-abbd-587ad4c84730`. The active MuAPI image/video backbone is therefore Production ready within the explicitly limited `$0` Sandbox scope; paid generation remains disabled and untested.

## Current Git and deployment state

Vercel shows the PR #12 Preview and matching `main` Production deployment as Ready. Owner-authenticated live verification of the deployed shell (Selena, Projects/Assets, `MuAPI · Sandbox` status) has not been repeated against Production since this merge.

## Existing capabilities

- GitHub OAuth owner authentication with state, PKCE, a signed short-lived session, immutable user-ID allowlisting, login allowlisting, logout, and same-origin mutation checks.
- Authenticated Creator Studio provider-status reporting that exposes readiness, model labels, and safe provider identity labels without credential values.
- A Production-deployed provider-neutral Brain Router for Gemini, Groq, OpenRouter, and the preserved Anthropic implementation, with normalized requests/results, bounded safe fallback, and fail-closed sensitivity routing.
- Anthropic creative assistant for strategy, planning, prompts, and scripts.
- MuAPI image generation through a server-owned Sandbox-first adapter with a fixed model and normalized immediate/asynchronous results.
- ElevenLabs speech generation using a server-configured reusable voice.
- HeyGen text-to-avatar submission and asynchronous polling with Greg's default Digital Twin identity, portrait `9:16` / `1080p` defaults, normalized responses, stricter validation, safe errors, and a future audio-input boundary.
- MuAPI text-to-video and image-to-video submission with asynchronous polling, fixed server-selected models, and provider-reachable HTTPS first-frame validation.
- Preserved but deferred direct OpenAI image and Runway video adapters.
- Private YouTube OAuth, private Vercel Blob staging, encrypted refresh-token/history storage, short-lived constrained browser upload tokens, duplicate-publish claims, explicit approval, and forced private uploads.
- Per-user/per-action rate limits, body/output limits, fixed provider hosts, request timeouts, no-store responses, content-safety enforcement, and sanitized provider errors.
- Security regression tests, repository tests, GitHub CI definitions, and CodeQL definitions.

## Provider and environment matrix

`Test pending` means there is no retained evidence of a successful real external-provider completion; it does not mean the adapter is absent or that a provider returned a failure.

| Integration | Code Built | Preview Configured | Production Configured | Real Test Passed | Production Ready |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GitHub Auth | Built | Configured | Configured | Test passed (Preview and Production, 2026-09-01) | No |
| Anthropic | Built | Missing | Missing | Test pending | No |
| MuAPI Image + Video | Built (Production) | Missing | Configured (Sandbox only) | General + private Production Sandbox passed | Yes — Sandbox scope |
| OpenAI Images (deferred) | Preserved; inactive | Configured | Configured | Not required for active cutover | No |
| ElevenLabs | Built | Missing | Configured | Test passed (Production, 2026-09-01) | No |
| HeyGen | Built | Missing | Missing | Test pending | No |
| Runway (deferred) | Preserved; inactive | Missing | Missing | Not required for active cutover | No |
| YouTube OAuth | Built | Missing | Configured | Test pending | No |
| Vercel Blob | Built | Configured | Configured | Test pending | No |

Preview GitHub variables are restricted to `feature/heygen-digital-twin`. The OAuth app has the stable Preview callback registered without wildcard matching, and an authenticated owner session was completed successfully on 2026-08-24.

### Configuration evidence

Only variable names and configuration state are recorded here. No credential value was read or copied.

#### Production configured

- GitHub Auth: `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GITHUB_OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL`, `CREATOR_GITHUB_ALLOWED_LOGINS`, `CREATOR_GITHUB_ALLOWED_USER_IDS`, `CREATOR_SESSION_SECRET`
- MuAPI Sandbox: `MUAPI_API_KEY`, `MUAPI_KEY_MODE`, `MUAPI_ALLOW_PAID_GENERATION`, `MUAPI_IMAGE_MODEL`, `MUAPI_VIDEO_MODEL`, `MUAPI_IMAGE_TO_VIDEO_MODEL`
- OpenAI Images: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- ElevenLabs: `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID`
- YouTube OAuth: `YOUTUBE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `YOUTUBE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `YOUTUBE_OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL`, `YOUTUBE_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- Vercel Blob: `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` (with a connected Blob store)

#### Production missing

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `HEYGEN_API_KEY`
- `HEYGEN_AVATAR_ID`
- `HEYGEN_VOICE_ID`
- `RUNWAY_API_KEY`

#### Preview configured

- All Preview branches: `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `feature/heygen-digital-twin` only: `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GITHUB_OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL`, `CREATOR_GITHUB_ALLOWED_LOGINS`, `CREATOR_GITHUB_ALLOWED_USER_IDS`, `CREATOR_SESSION_SECRET`
- `feature/heygen-digital-twin` only: `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID`
- `feature/heygen-digital-twin` only: `HEYGEN_AVATAR_ID`, `HEYGEN_VOICE_ID`
- `feature/heygen-digital-twin` only: `YOUTUBE_OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL`

#### Preview missing for a full Phase 1 test

- `MUAPI_API_KEY`
- `MUAPI_KEY_MODE`
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`
- `HEYGEN_API_KEY`
- `RUNWAY_API_KEY`
- `YOUTUBE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
- `YOUTUBE_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`

The Vercel entries named `ANTHPOC`, `runway`, `Elevenlabs`, `myvocie`, and `openai` do not satisfy the exact server-side names expected by the application. Vercel does not reveal saved Secret values, so API-key values stored under those misspelled names must be re-entered under the correct names. The lowercase `openai` entry is redundant because `OPENAI_API_KEY` is already configured.

## Provider implementation details

### GitHub Auth

- Routes: `GET /api/auth/github/start`, `GET /api/auth/github/callback`, `GET /api/auth/session`, and `POST /api/auth/logout`
- Production OAuth application and required Vercel variables: configured
- Live Production start flow: reached GitHub's authorization screen for G.FURY Creator Studio and used `https://open-generative-ai-lemon.vercel.app/api/auth/github/callback`
- Repository permissions: not requested
- Owner controls: immutable GitHub user-ID allowlist configured; login allowlist also configured in Production
- Signed Production session: HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax, eight-hour default expiration
- Preview OAuth application, exact callback, owner allowlists, and branch-scoped secrets: configured
- Preview authorization callback and signed-session test: passed for `@lalambert1982-eng` on 2026-08-24
- Production callback, session persistence across refresh, and logout test: **passed 2026-09-01** against the live Production deployment

### Anthropic

- Compatibility handler/tool: `handleAnthropicAssistant` / `anthropic_assistant`
- Production Creator Studio route: `POST /api/creator/assistant` through the provider-neutral Brain Router
- Default model: `claude-sonnet-5`
- Credential use: server-side `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` only
- Source/UI: existing implementation preserved; optional brain provider
- Production and Preview: configuration required
- Real request: pending

### OpenAI Images

- Active route: none; the private `POST /api/creator/image` route is assigned to MuAPI
- Default model: `gpt-image-2`
- Default quality: `low`
- Credential use: server-side `OPENAI_API_KEY` only
- Source/tool registry: preserved and marked deferred
- Private Creator Studio UI/dispatch: inactive
- Production and Preview: configured
- Real request: not required for the active MuAPI cutover

### MuAPI Image and Video

- Routes: `POST /api/creator/image`, `POST /api/creator/video`, and `GET /api/creator/muapi/status`
- Default image model: `nano-banana`
- Default text-to-video model: `seedance-lite-t2v`
- Default image-to-video model: `kling-v2.1-master-i2v`
- Credential use: Sandbox selects server-side `MUAPI_API_KEY`; Production selects the separate server-side `MUAPI_PRODUCTION_API_KEY`
- Cost gate: `MUAPI_KEY_MODE=sandbox` is the safe default; production mode also requires `MUAPI_ALLOW_PAID_GENERATION=true`
- Source/UI: built, merged, and deployed through PR #8
- General Studio live Sandbox mock: passed at `$0` on 2026-08-26
- Private Creator Studio live Sandbox mock: passed task `8c3dc22a-f59a-4c74-abbd-587ad4c84730` on Production on 2026-08-26
- Paid generation: disabled by `MUAPI_ALLOW_PAID_GENERATION=false`; not tested or approved

### ElevenLabs

- Route: `POST /api/creator/speech`
- Default model: `eleven_multilingual_v2`
- Credential use: server-side `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` and `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID`
- Source/UI: built
- Production: configured
- Preview: voice ID configured; `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` still required
- Real speech generation: **passed 2026-09-01** — a short test clip was generated and played back successfully through the live, owner-authenticated Production Creator Studio shell

The existing production voice ID was not revealed or overwritten during this audit. The original Production `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` returned a `401`/`403` during this test session; the key was rotated in the ElevenLabs dashboard and the new value was set in Vercel Production, after which generation succeeded. The prior key should be treated as retired.

The currently reported ElevenLabs `401`/`403` remains a credential/permission blocker. The Storyboard candidate preserves the Voice UI and secure server route and does not change this provider configuration.

### HeyGen

- Routes: `POST /api/creator/heygen`, `GET /api/creator/heygen/status`
- Default engine label: `Avatar IV`
- Credential use: server-side `HEYGEN_API_KEY`, `HEYGEN_AVATAR_ID`, and `HEYGEN_VOICE_ID`
- Asynchronous job polling: built
- Source/UI: built
- Greg Digital Twin hardening: complete and deployed to Production through PR #6
- Preview: approved avatar and voice IDs configured; `HEYGEN_API_KEY` still required
- Production: configuration required
- Real avatar generation: pending

### Runway

- Active routes: none; the private `POST /api/creator/video` and MuAPI status routes replace the old dispatch
- Default model: `gen4.5`
- API version: `2024-11-06`
- First-frame rule: optional provider-reachable HTTPS URL; local file paths are rejected
- Credential use: server-side `RUNWAY_API_KEY` only
- Source/tool registry and polling: preserved and marked deferred
- Private Creator Studio UI/dispatch: inactive
- Production and Preview: configuration required
- Real video generation: not required for the active MuAPI cutover

### YouTube and Vercel Blob

- OAuth scope: `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/youtube.upload`
- OAuth state/PKCE and identity binding: built
- Refresh-token/history encryption: AES-256-GCM before private Blob storage
- Staging: private Blob with authenticated user-bound path, type, size, age, and signature checks
- Publish approval: explicit `approved === true` required
- Visibility: forced `private`; subscriber notification disabled
- Connect/status/stage/publish/disconnect routes: built
- Production variables and Blob store: configured
- Private store existence and private-Blob mode: verified in Vercel
- Exact live Google redirect registration: not independently visible because Google Cloud Console was unavailable to the audit browser
- Real connect/disconnect and private upload: pending

## Known safe production identifiers

These identifiers are safe configuration metadata, not credentials. They are the approved application defaults; saved Vercel Secret values were not exposed or copied during deployment, and exact Production environment presence still requires a settings-level recheck.

| Identifier | Value |
|---|---|
| Greg Digital Twin look ID | `cae16de37d204cdc98a8c36dd859cd46` |
| Greg HeyGen voice ID | `aecf8d74f6b8467b84d24e9dc541b19a` |
| Greg Avatar Group ID (reference only) | `e998e58ee3094ecbb1787d478b6fa082` |

The Avatar Group ID must never replace `HEYGEN_AVATAR_ID`; HeyGen video generation requires the Digital Twin look ID.

## Phase 1 tool registry

The Production release exposes the existing implementations through one metadata registry without duplicating provider logic:

| Tool ID | Existing implementation |
|---|---|
| `brain_reasoning` | Provider-neutral Gemini/Groq/OpenRouter/Anthropic reasoning boundary |
| `anthropic_assistant` | Anthropic assistant handler |
| `muapi_image` | Active MuAPI image job adapter and poller |
| `muapi_video` | Active MuAPI text/image-to-video job adapter and poller |
| `openai_image` | Preserved, deferred OpenAI image handler |
| `elevenlabs_voice` | ElevenLabs speech handler |
| `heygen_avatar_video` | HeyGen job adapter and poller |
| `runway_video` | Preserved, deferred Runway job handler and poller |
| `youtube_publish` | Authenticated private YouTube publisher |

The Brain Router is a reusable reasoning boundary for the existing agents. It does not add Phase 2 company memory, project memory, workflow state, approval queues, autonomous tool execution, or Selena-specific business logic.

## Security posture

- Provider and OAuth credentials remain in server-only environment variables; no provider secret is placed in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` state or browser storage.
- Production Creator Studio uses a `__Host-creator_session` HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax cookie.
- The default session lifetime is eight hours and is capped at 24 hours.
- Paid mutations, logout, YouTube connect, Blob staging, and publishing enforce authenticated identity and same-origin restrictions.
- The owner gate supports immutable GitHub user IDs and optional matching logins; when both are configured, both must match.
- Content safety defaults to `enforce`. `audit` and `off` require an explicit operator configuration and are not the default.
- Provider requests have fixed destinations, strict inputs, timeouts, size caps, sanitized errors, and per-user/per-action rate limits.
- MuAPI paid generation fails closed: Sandbox is the default, and a production key also requires an explicit paid-generation enable flag.
- YouTube refresh tokens and history remain encrypted; browser responses do not include provider keys, GitHub tokens, Google access tokens, or Google refresh tokens.
- YouTube publication cannot become public automatically.

The generic credential-assignment scan matched only synthetic test fixtures in `tests/security`; it found no deployment credential file or production credential value. The build emitted an existing outdated Browserslist database warning, which is non-blocking.

The PR #6 release candidate passed GitHub CI, CodeQL, Vercel Preview, 99 local tests, and the local production build before merge. The MuAPI PR #8 release separately passed 108 local tests, the production build, CI, CodeQL, and Vercel Preview. Vercel reported merge commit `3f18f446cb24d88c3b0b1b59ec53d944896d24c8` Ready in Production before the authenticated `$0` Sandbox completion test.

## Remaining real tests

1. ~~Complete Production GitHub authorization, callback, signed-session, session-expiry, and logout testing with the allowlisted account.~~ **Passed 2026-09-01.**
2. Generate one short Anthropic concept/script after adding its key (`ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` still missing in Production).
3. ~~Generate one short ElevenLabs clip with the configured canonical Greg/G.FURY voice.~~ **Passed 2026-09-01**, after rotating the Production `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`.
4. Generate one short Greg HeyGen Digital Twin video and poll it to completion after `HEYGEN_API_KEY`, `HEYGEN_AVATAR_ID`, and `HEYGEN_VOICE_ID` are added to Production (currently only present in the `feature/heygen-digital-twin` Preview scope).
5. Keep paid MuAPI generation disabled until a separate budget, credits, and artifact-specific approval are recorded; no paid video test is required for this Sandbox cutover.
6. Complete YouTube connect, private Blob staging, explicit approval, PRIVATE upload, history, and disconnect/revoke testing.
7. Confirm the exact Production YouTube callback in both Vercel and the Google OAuth web client during the connect test.

Use the shortest, lowest-cost safe artifacts possible. Do not make a YouTube test video public.

## Genuine remaining blockers

1. Preview does not contain the server-owned MuAPI configuration; the verified deployment scope is Production Sandbox only.
2. The Production YouTube OAuth/Blob flow has not completed a real PRIVATE upload, and the exact Google redirect registration was not independently visible during this audit.
3. The `main` branch is not protected, so merge review and CI are not enforced by a branch rule.
4. Provider API credits/quota must be sufficient for the remaining non-MuAPI live tests; the active MuAPI cutover remains in `$0` Sandbox mode.

## Manual actions still required

1. Re-verify every remaining non-MuAPI Preview and Production variable under its exact application name. Do not delete a misspelled Secret entry until its correctly named replacement has been verified.
2. In the Google OAuth web client, confirm the Preview and Production redirects exactly match the URLs documented above and that the publishing account is allowed while the app is in testing mode.
3. Complete the minimal real-test sequence above and record successful job/video IDs without recording credentials.
4. Add a GitHub branch ruleset for `main` that requires pull requests and passing CI/security checks before merge.

## Phase 1 completion criteria

Phase 1 can be frozen as **G.FURY Creator Studio v1** only after all of the following are true:

- The release changes remain merged to `main` and the matching Production commit remains Ready.
- Required Production variables are configured without exposing their values.
- GitHub owner authentication completes successfully in Production.
- MuAPI completes the approved `$0` private Creator Studio Sandbox test; Anthropic, ElevenLabs, and HeyGen each complete any separately agreed minimal real test. Deferred OpenAI/Runway adapters are not Phase 1 active-path requirements.
- YouTube connects, stages privately, uploads one approved test video as PRIVATE, records safe history, and disconnects/revokes correctly.
- Security tests, provider tests, authentication tests, YouTube tests, committed-secret scan, CI/CodeQL, and the production build pass on the merge candidate.
- A `main` branch rule requires pull-request review and the passing CI/security checks.
- This document is updated with the deployed commit and real-test evidence.

## Determination

**PHASE 1 NOT COMPLETE**

PR #12 merging and auto-deploying to Production (2026-09-01) advances the integrated Creator shell from "built, not deployed" to "deployed, not yet owner-verified in Production." It does not by itself satisfy any of the completion criteria above, all of which still require real owner-authenticated and provider-level testing that has not been performed.
