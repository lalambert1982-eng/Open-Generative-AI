# G.FURY Creator Studio v1 — Phase 1 Status

Authoritative reconciliation snapshot for `lalambert1982-eng/Open-Generative-AI`. Deployment evidence was last reconciled on 2026-08-25, including the approved Brain Router and Greg Digital Twin Production deployment.

This document distinguishes four independent states:

- **Built**: the source implementation, authenticated server route, and Creator Studio connection exist.
- **Configured**: the required variables exist in the named Vercel environment.
- **Test passed**: a real request reached the external provider and completed successfully.
- **Production ready**: built, configured, real-tested, secure, documented, merged, and deployed.

Configuration is not implementation. A provider with a missing API key remains **Built — configuration required**.

## Brain Router release — Production deployed

PR #6 merged the provider-neutral Selena reasoning boundary and Greg Digital Twin hardening into `main` without recreating the existing agents. Vercel reports Production commit `3d6ea7882e8033b374dd9b9d65a51a2dcc30f1ff` as Ready. The release passed mocked/local and CI verification, but no real external-provider generation was run as part of deployment.

| Brain provider | Code Built | Preview Configured | Production Configured | Test Passed | Production Ready |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Gemini | Built (Production) | Not re-verified | Not re-verified | Mock test passed | No |
| Groq | Built (Production) | Not re-verified | Not re-verified | Mock test passed | No |
| OpenRouter | Built (Production) | Not re-verified | Not re-verified | Mock test passed | No |
| Anthropic | Built (existing + router compatibility) | Not re-verified | Not re-verified | Mock test passed | No |

Initial routing is Gemini → Groq → OpenRouter with at most three attempts. Anthropic remains selectable but is not included in the initial free/developer fallback order. “Free/developer” describes the intended account tier, not a guarantee of zero cost; provider limits and billing still apply.

Provider availability still depends on the exact Preview and Production variables documented in `CREATOR_STUDIO.md`. The deployment did not copy credentials between environments or reveal saved Secret values. No real provider request was made during this release.

Vercel shows both the current Production deployment and the current `feature/heygen-digital-twin` Preview deployment as Ready. The stable Preview alias uses the branch-specific GitHub OAuth callback and the current reconciliation commit.

## Existing capabilities

- GitHub OAuth owner authentication with state, PKCE, a signed short-lived session, immutable user-ID allowlisting, login allowlisting, logout, and same-origin mutation checks.
- Authenticated Creator Studio provider-status reporting that exposes readiness, model labels, and safe provider identity labels without credential values.
- A Production-deployed provider-neutral Brain Router for Gemini, Groq, OpenRouter, and the preserved Anthropic implementation, with normalized requests/results, bounded safe fallback, and fail-closed sensitivity routing.
- Anthropic creative assistant for strategy, planning, prompts, and scripts.
- OpenAI image generation with configurable size/quality and a low-cost default.
- ElevenLabs speech generation using a server-configured reusable voice.
- HeyGen text-to-avatar submission and asynchronous polling with Greg's default Digital Twin identity, portrait `9:16` / `1080p` defaults, normalized responses, stricter validation, safe errors, and a future audio-input boundary.
- Runway text-to-video and image-to-video submission with asynchronous polling and provider-reachable HTTPS first-frame validation.
- Private YouTube OAuth, private Vercel Blob staging, encrypted refresh-token/history storage, short-lived constrained browser upload tokens, duplicate-publish claims, explicit approval, and forced private uploads.
- Per-user/per-action rate limits, body/output limits, fixed provider hosts, request timeouts, no-store responses, content-safety enforcement, and sanitized provider errors.
- Security regression tests, repository tests, GitHub CI definitions, and CodeQL definitions.

## Provider and environment matrix

`Test pending` means there is no retained evidence of a successful real external-provider completion; it does not mean the adapter is absent or that a provider returned a failure.

| Integration | Code Built | Preview Configured | Production Configured | Real Test Passed | Production Ready |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| GitHub Auth | Built | Configured | Configured | Test passed (Preview) | No |
| Anthropic | Built | Missing | Missing | Test pending | No |
| OpenAI Images | Built | Configured | Configured | Test pending | No |
| ElevenLabs | Built | Missing | Configured | Test pending | No |
| HeyGen | Built | Missing | Missing | Test pending | No |
| Runway | Built | Missing | Missing | Test pending | No |
| YouTube OAuth | Built | Missing | Configured | Test pending | No |
| Vercel Blob | Built | Configured | Configured | Test pending | No |

Preview GitHub variables are restricted to `feature/heygen-digital-twin`. The OAuth app has the stable Preview callback registered without wildcard matching, and an authenticated owner session was completed successfully on 2026-08-24.

### Configuration evidence

Only variable names and configuration state are recorded here. No credential value was read or copied.

#### Production configured

- GitHub Auth: `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GITHUB_OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL`, `CREATOR_GITHUB_ALLOWED_LOGINS`, `CREATOR_GITHUB_ALLOWED_USER_IDS`, `CREATOR_SESSION_SECRET`
- OpenAI Images: `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- ElevenLabs: `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`, `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID`
- YouTube OAuth: `YOUTUBE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `YOUTUBE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `YOUTUBE_OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL`, `YOUTUBE_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`
- Vercel Blob: `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN` (with a connected Blob store)

#### Production missing

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `HEYGEN_API_KEY`
- `HEYGEN_AVATAR_ID`
- `HEYGEN_VOICE_ID`
- `RUNWAY_API_KEY`

#### Preview configured

- All Preview branches: `BLOB_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`
- `feature/heygen-digital-twin` only: `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`, `GITHUB_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`, `GITHUB_OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL`, `CREATOR_GITHUB_ALLOWED_LOGINS`, `CREATOR_GITHUB_ALLOWED_USER_IDS`, `CREATOR_SESSION_SECRET`
- `feature/heygen-digital-twin` only: `ELEVENLABS_VOICE_ID`
- `feature/heygen-digital-twin` only: `HEYGEN_AVATAR_ID`, `HEYGEN_VOICE_ID`
- `feature/heygen-digital-twin` only: `YOUTUBE_OAUTH_CALLBACK_URL`

#### Preview missing for a full Phase 1 test

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `ELEVENLABS_API_KEY`
- `HEYGEN_API_KEY`
- `RUNWAY_API_KEY`
- `YOUTUBE_OAUTH_CLIENT_ID`
- `YOUTUBE_OAUTH_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `YOUTUBE_TOKEN_ENCRYPTION_KEY`

The Vercel entries named `ANTHPOC`, `runway`, `Elevenlabs`, `myvocie`, and `openai` do not satisfy the exact server-side names expected by the application. Vercel does not reveal saved Secret values, so API-key values stored under those misspelled names must be re-entered under the correct names. The lowercase `openai` entry is redundant because `OPENAI_API_KEY` is already configured.

## Known safe production identifiers

These identifiers are safe configuration metadata, not credentials. They are the approved application defaults; saved Vercel Secret values were not exposed or copied during deployment, and exact Production environment presence still requires a settings-level recheck.

| Identifier | Value |
|---|---|
| Greg Digital Twin look ID | `cae16de37d204cdc98a8c36dd859cd46` |
| Greg HeyGen voice ID | `aecf8d74f6b8467b84d24e9dc541b19a` |
| Greg Avatar Group ID (reference only) | `e998e58ee3094ecbb1787d478b6fa082` |

The Avatar Group ID must never replace `HEYGEN_AVATAR_ID`; HeyGen video generation requires the Digital Twin look ID.

## Phase 1 tool registry

The Production release exposes the existing implementations through one metadata registry without duplicating provider logic:

| Tool ID | Existing implementation |
|---|---|
| `brain_reasoning` | Provider-neutral Gemini/Groq/OpenRouter/Anthropic reasoning boundary |
| `anthropic_assistant` | Anthropic assistant handler |
| `openai_image` | OpenAI image handler |
| `elevenlabs_voice` | ElevenLabs speech handler |
| `heygen_avatar_video` | HeyGen job adapter and poller |
| `runway_video` | Runway job handler and poller |
| `youtube_publish` | Authenticated private YouTube publisher |

The Brain Router is a reusable reasoning boundary for the existing agents. It does not add Phase 2 company memory, project memory, workflow state, approval queues, autonomous tool execution, or Selena-specific business logic.

## Security posture

- Provider and OAuth credentials remain in server-only environment variables; no provider secret is placed in `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` state or browser storage.
- Production Creator Studio uses a `__Host-creator_session` HttpOnly, Secure, SameSite=Lax cookie.
- The default session lifetime is eight hours and is capped at 24 hours.
- Paid mutations, logout, YouTube connect, Blob staging, and publishing enforce authenticated identity and same-origin restrictions.
- The owner gate supports immutable GitHub user IDs and optional matching logins; when both are configured, both must match.
- Content safety defaults to `enforce`. `audit` and `off` require an explicit operator configuration and are not the default.
- Provider requests have fixed destinations, strict inputs, timeouts, size caps, sanitized errors, and per-user/per-action rate limits.
- YouTube refresh tokens and history remain encrypted; browser responses do not include provider keys, GitHub tokens, Google access tokens, or Google refresh tokens.
- YouTube publication cannot become public automatically.

## Verification results

| Verification | Result |
|---|---|
| Security/auth/brain/provider/YouTube tests | 82 passed, 0 failed |
| Existing repository tests | 17 passed, 0 failed |
| Total automated tests | 99 passed, 0 failed |
| Workflow Builder compilation | 22 files compiled |
| AI Agent compilation | 11 files compiled |
| Design Agent compilation | 4 files compiled |
| Studio compilation | 26 files compiled |
| Next.js production build | Passed |
| Brain Router release-candidate strong-secret scan | 0 matches |
| Brain Router committed-tree strong-secret scan | 0 matches |
| Tracked non-example `.env` files | 0 |

The generic credential-assignment scan matched only synthetic test fixtures in `tests/security`; it found no deployment credential file or production credential value. The build emitted an existing outdated Browserslist database warning, which is non-blocking.

The PR #6 release candidate passed GitHub CI, CodeQL, Vercel Preview, 99 local tests, and the local production build before merge. Vercel then reported the matching `main` Production deployment as Ready.

## Remaining real tests

1. Complete Production GitHub authorization, callback, signed-session, session-expiry, and logout testing with the allowlisted account.
2. Generate one short Anthropic concept/script after adding its key.
3. Generate one low-cost OpenAI image after adding its key.
4. Generate one short ElevenLabs clip with the configured canonical Greg/G.FURY voice.
5. Generate one short Greg HeyGen Digital Twin video and poll it to completion after all three HeyGen variables are present in the test environment.
6. Submit and poll one minimal Runway job if credits are available.
7. Complete YouTube connect, private Blob staging, explicit approval, PRIVATE upload, history, and disconnect/revoke testing.
8. Confirm the exact Production YouTube callback in both Vercel and the Google OAuth web client during the connect test.

Use the shortest, lowest-cost safe artifacts possible. Do not make a YouTube test video public.

## Genuine remaining blockers

1. Exact Preview and Production provider-variable presence was not re-verified after deployment; the earlier configuration evidence above remains the last settings-level audit.
2. No successful real external-provider generation is documented yet.
3. The Production YouTube OAuth/Blob flow has not completed a real PRIVATE upload, and the exact Google redirect registration was not independently visible during this audit.
4. The `main` branch is not protected, so merge review and CI are not enforced by a branch rule.
5. Provider API credits/quota must be sufficient for the minimal live tests.

## Manual actions still required

1. Re-verify every required Preview and Production variable under its exact application name. Do not delete a misspelled Secret entry until its correctly named replacement has been verified.
2. In the Google OAuth web client, confirm the Preview and Production redirects exactly match the URLs documented above and that the publishing account is allowed while the app is in testing mode.
3. Complete the minimal real-test sequence above and record successful job/video IDs without recording credentials.
4. Add a GitHub branch ruleset for `main` that requires pull requests and passing CI/security checks before merge.

## Phase 1 completion criteria

Phase 1 can be frozen as **G.FURY Creator Studio v1** only after all of the following are true:

- The release changes remain merged to `main` and the matching Production commit remains Ready.
- Required Production variables are configured without exposing their values.
- GitHub owner authentication completes successfully in Production.
- Anthropic, OpenAI Images, ElevenLabs, HeyGen, and Runway each complete the agreed minimal real test; Runway may be explicitly deferred only if Greg accepts provider credits as the sole remaining limitation.
- YouTube connects, stages privately, uploads one approved test video as PRIVATE, records safe history, and disconnects/revokes correctly.
- Security tests, provider tests, authentication tests, YouTube tests, committed-secret scan, CI/CodeQL, and the production build pass on the merge candidate.
- A `main` branch rule requires pull-request review and the passing CI/security checks.
- This document is updated with the deployed commit and real-test evidence.

## Determination

**PHASE 1 NOT COMPLETE**
